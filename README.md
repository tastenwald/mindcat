# MindCat

An extended version of the WordPress plugin "MindCat", which can be found [here](https://wordpress.com/plugins/mindcat).

So it might be an enhanced "enhanced category display as mindmap or list of cards with colors and images", as described in the [original readme.txt](readme.txt).

This version has at least two disadvantages:

1. It could not be updated via the plugins section in the WordPress backend (without overwriting any changes).
2. It is not connected to the WordPress code repository, as they basically use Subversion (SVN) as their version control system. (Therefore it is not part of the WordPress ecosystem, e.g. it is not rated or monitored.)

If you still want to use it, you have to upload it manually. After downloading it as a zip file, you could follow these [instructions](https://wordpress.com/support/plugins/install-a-plugin/#install-a-plugin-with-a-zip-file).

## New features

- Full-screen: Each mind map can be viewed in full-screen mode.
